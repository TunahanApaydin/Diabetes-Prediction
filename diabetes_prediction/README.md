The aim of the project is to predict diabetes. 'Diabetes prediction dataset()', which can be accessed from the Kaggle platform, was used as the dataset.
The dataset contains information in 8 categories. Some of these categories contain categorical data.
For a better model training, one hot encoding process was applied to the categorical data. Thus, the number of inputs of the model increased to 15.
